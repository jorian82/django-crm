# Initialize virtual environment

Creating a space for our dependencies is vital to the development, that way we don't include
in a global scope dependencies that will only be part of our application.

We acomplish that by creating a virtual environment for our application, we use the following 
command:

```
python -m venv path/to/the/virtual-env/folder
```

## Install initial dependencies

Once the virtual environment is ready we need to activate it by using the following command:

```
source path/to/the/virtual-envi/folder/bin/activate
```

After activation we can now start adding dependencies to it by using pip command, since this is 
a django project we start by adding the django dependency:

```
pip install django
```

Note that by using only the name of the dependency we are asking the pip command to install the 
latest version of the library, as of now for this dependency it is 4.1

The pip command will install django and a few other libraries it relies on to work, after the 
install is completed we can store the dependencies list for future venv initialization, this is 
regularly stored in a requirements.txt file and this is done by typing:

```
pip freeze >> requirements.txt
```

# Setting up the .gitignore file

Now that we have our environment up and running, we'll require version control to store and save 
our project for future references, to do so, first we remove all files generated by the project 
compile and files only used locally in our computer to make the project available and ready to be 
initialized by any other developer/contributor.

A good way to start is copying the content of the following [url](https://djangowaves.com/tips-tricks/gitignore-for-a-django-project/) into a .gitignore file in our 
project
